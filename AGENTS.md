# AGENTS.md - Agent Documentation

## Project Overview

**reddit-kv** is project that uses Reddit as a key-value store, using a subreddit as a database, posts Ids as keys and comments as values.  The interface and features is simple CRUD, like memcached, although we are not performance concerned.

You will select the most appropraite technology to create this.  I, the human,  personally prefer Golang for it, but will be open to your technology choices.  I'm an experienced dev so you can ask me pointed questions.

This project is a reply to this [HackerNews comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46702344) about a typo of using Reddit as a Key-Value store.  Funny as hell.  But also, it's in a thread about whether [vibe coding really works](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243), so let's prove or disprove it.
